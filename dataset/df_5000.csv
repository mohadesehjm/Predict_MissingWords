These units showed stable net interest margins, [BLANK] a weakness in consumer banking. Market income also supports its revenue, as market volatility fuels demand for risk management and treasury business. Reduced credit costs bode well for its earnings too.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which [BLANK] defective steam generators, was held liable by the International Chamber of Commerce panel for only one of five claims, saying the contract's liability limit eliminated most of MHI's exposure.

An April report from CNN [BLANK] concerns over Nuplazid's safety profile, and while we think the analysis was flawed, it may have affected prescribing habits. There's a risk for the drug for Parkinson's disease psychosis to miss estimates of $60 million in 2Q with $56-$58 million more likely, based on Symphony data and gross-to-net expectations. A caveat is that Symphony data only captures a small portion of Nuplazid volume and Acadia's switch to the sell-in method may affect the reported number. Expect 2018 guidance to be a big focus on the call, especially if Nuplazid misses, given it implies a significant uptick in 2H.

True, the company's 1Qs show some similarity, but the magnitude of the decline suggests competition from superior products is [BLANK] pressure.

Sales may jump 10.6% in 2017 to 596,000, followed by a 6.5% increase in 2018 to 635,000.
