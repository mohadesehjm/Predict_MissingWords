These units showed stable net interest margins, offsetting a weakness in consumer banking. Market income also supports its revenue, as market volatility fuels demand for risk management and treasury business. Reduced credit costs bode well for its earnings too. Separately, NAB and peers' profit will suffer from the proposed 6-bp levy on liabilities.",
