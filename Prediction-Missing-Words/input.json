Bovids retain undigested food in their stomachs to be regurgitated and  again as necessary Bovids are almost exclusively herbivorous. Most bovids  30 to 32 teeth. While the upper incisors are absent, the upper canines are either reduced or absent. Instead of the upper incisors, bovids have a thick and tough layer of tissue, called the dental pad, which provides a surface to  grasses and foliage. All bovids have four toes on each foot\u2014they  on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground. Bovid horns vary in shape and size: the relatively simple horns of a large Indian buffalo may measure around 4m from tip to tip along the outer curve, while the various gazelles have horns with a variety of elegant curves.\n",
