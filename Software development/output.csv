These units showed stable net interest margins, offsetting a weakness in consumer banking. Market income also supports its revenue, as market volatility fuels demand for risk management and treasury business. Reduced credit costs bode well for its earnings too. Separately, NAB and peers' profit will suffer from the proposed 6-bp levy on liabilities.",,,,,,,,,,

An April report from CNN sparked concerns over Nuplazid's safety profile, and while we think the analysis was flawed, it may have affected prescribing habits. There's a risk for the drug for Parkinson's disease psychosis to miss estimates of $60 million in 2Q with $56-$58 million more likely, based on Symphony data and gross-to-net expectations. A caveat is that Symphony data only captures a small portion of Nuplazid volume and Acadia's switch to the sell-in method may affect the reported number. Expect 2018 guidance to be a big focus on the call, especially if Nuplazid misses, given it implies a significant uptick in 2H.
